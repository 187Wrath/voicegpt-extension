# Privacy Policy for VoiceGPT Browser Automation

**Effective Date:** September 30, 2025

VoiceGPT Browser Automation (“the Extension”) respects your privacy.  
This policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.

## Data Collection
- The Extension processes **user prompts and voice input** to send queries to ChatGPT.  
- Optional: if configured, prompts and responses may be logged to a backend server specified by the user.  
- No personal data is collected, sold, or shared by the Extension.

## Data Storage
- User preferences (backend URL, model selection, settings) are stored locally using Chrome’s storage API.  
- No external storage occurs unless the user enables backend logging.

## Permissions
- **Storage**: to save user preferences.  
- **Scripting / ActiveTab / Tabs**: to run automation commands on the user’s active page when requested.  
- **Host Permissions**: to connect to ChatGPT’s API and an optional backend.

## Third-Party Services
- OpenAI API is used to process prompts and generate responses.  
- If backend logging is enabled, the destination is user-controlled.

## Data Sharing
- No collected data is sold, rented, or shared with third parties.  
- All data stays local unless the user configures backend logging.

## Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your information. However, as with all internet applications, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
